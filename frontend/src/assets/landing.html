<h2>Welcome to the BIBBOX - FAIR Toolbox</h2>
<p>
 The BIBBOX (Basic Infrastructure Building Box) offers an easy installation, 
  deployment and integration of open-source software solutions (Apps) in the fields of bioinformatics and biobanking.
</p>
<p>
 In the BIBBOX framework, the software tools are simply a group of Docker Containers, ready to be used. Therefore, they can run quickly and reliably in any 
  computing environment. By providing a catalog of pre-configured bioinformatics tools and applications, the BIBBOX allows users to install and run them in a 
  standardized and reproducible manner. Among other applications, the Bibbox enables the integration of a FAIR Data Point into the respective apps.
</p>
<p>
  Some key features of BIBBOX include:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Application Catalog:</b> A collection of bioinformatics tools and applications for various research tasks.</li>
  <li><b>Containerization:</b> Utilizes Docker to encapsulate applications and ensure consistent execution.</li>
  <li><b>User Management:</b> Provides user access control and permission management.</li>
  <li><b>Fair Data Point (FDP):</b> Provides a standardized and interoperable component or service for facilitating the discovery, access, and sharing of research data, ensuring transparency, accessibility, and reusability.</li>
